This is the SQLBOX FAQ.
It's function is to help people going, at least before there is a proper documentation patch.

Q.
How do I compile sqlbox support into Kannel?

A.
Check out the sqlbox module from the kannel repository:
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.kannel.org:/home/cvs co sqlbox
cd sqlbox && make patch
Then (as usual): make distclean; ./configure --your-options; make
Dont forget to include some kind of SQL support (MySQL or Postgress) in --your-options.

Q.
Is there any documentation that could help in setting it up and gain a better understanding of it?

A.
When runnig for the first time, sqlbox creates automatically 2 tables, called send_sms and sent_sms (configurable).

In the first table, you can insert SMS messages that will be sent out (MT). In the second table, all SMS traffic from and to
smsbox is logged.
 
The patch includes Postgres, MySQL and MS-SQL support (also for DLR's) for anybody that feels the need to use it.
MS-SQL client libraries are either sybase or free-tds (./configure autodetects).

 
In kannel.conf, the following options are added:

Here follows some documentation that in fact (I admit) should be included in the patch against the doc tree:
There is one extra configure option in group = smsbox, which is:

# bearerbox-is-sqlbox indicates if the smsbox is connected to the bearerbox or an sql box
bearerbox-is-sqlbox = true/false

For the rest, the group = sqlbox contains the following options:

group = sqlbox
# id corresponds to id in group = mysql-connection.
# this is analogous to id in group = dlr-db
id = dlr-db2
# smsbox-id indicates the box where SQL-injected messages appear to be coming fr
om
smsbox-id = sqlbox2
# bearerbox host to connect to
bearerbox-host = "127.0.0.1"
# smsbox port to be listening on
smsbox-port = 13005
smsbox-port-ssl = false
# sql-log-table is the table used to log all sent messages
sql-log-table = sent_sms
# sql-insert-table is the table that is monitored for new messages to send
sql-insert-table = send_sms
# global sender: If no sender is specified in sql-insert-table then this
# value is used.
global-sender = 06121
# log-file = ""
# log-level = 10
# ssl-client-certkey-file = ""
# ssl-server-cert-file = ""
# ssl-server-key-file = ""
# ssl-trusted-ca-file = ""

Q.
Does sqlbox replace sms box or is It an additional module that must be run?

A.
sqlbox is an additional module. You now have to start kannel in the following manner:

1st: bearerbox <conf-file>
2nd: sqlbox <conf-file>
3rd: smsbox <conf-file> and wapbox <conf-file>

A picture of the new situation (with sqlbox included is as follows):

http request <--> [ smsbox ] <--> [ sqlbox ] <--> [ bearerbox ] <--> sms gateway

I hope this picture make things clear. In text: sqlbox is sitting in between smsbox and bearerbox, passing all messages back and forth between the two. As a side-effect, also the messages that are passed back and forth are logged in the sent_sms table.

Q.
Can you use http requests or posting messages to the send_sms table to send messages?

A.
You can use both http requests to the smsbox, as usual (nothing changes here), as well as insert messages in send_sms. SQL Box checks the records in send_sms every so many seconds and posts them to the bearerbox to be delivered to the SMSC. After that, the entry in send_sms is deleted.

Q. (Configuration options part #1)
bearerbox-is-sqlbox = true/false 
If this value is set to true would you not have to run the sqlbox as the bearerbox should function as the sqlbox?

A.
It is as follows: if this value is set to true then smsbox connects to sqlbox, rather than the bearerbox.
(see the previous picture)

Q. (Configuration options part #2)
smsbox-id = sqlbox2 -> Can this be any unique string?

A.
Yes, exactly.

Q. (Configuration options part #3)
# smsbox port to be listening on
smsbox-port = 13005 -> must this value be the same as the send-sms-port value in the smsbox?

A.
Nopes. This smsbox-port is the port that the bearerbox or sqlbox listen on to connections from smsbox.
send-sms-port is a different port. It is the port that smsbox listens on to http requests to receive messages.
